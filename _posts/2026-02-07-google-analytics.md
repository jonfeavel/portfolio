## Executive TL/DR
This capstone analyzes smart device usage data for Bellabeat, a women’s wellness technology company, to identify behavioral trends and translate them into actionable product and marketing recommendations. Using a structured data analyst framework:

**Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act**

I combined quantitative analysis with contextual framing (personas, journeys, and lifecycle considerations) to move beyond descriptive statistics and toward product-relevant insight.

The analysis surfaced clear relationships between activity volume, intensity, time-of-day usage patterns, and calorie expenditure. Segmenting users by behavioral profiles revealed meaningful differences in engagement and opportunity areas for personalization.

The outcome was a set of pragmatic, data-informed strategic recommendations:

<div class="recommendation-grid">
  <div class="rec-card">
    <h4>Segmented Experiences</h4>
    <p>Tailor in-app content, insights, and notifications to distinct lifestyle and activity profiles (e.g., high-intensity achievers vs. casual trackers).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="rec-card">
    <h4>Time-Based Engagement</h4>
    <p>Deploy time-aware campaigns and nudges aligned to when users are most active, particularly for subscription engagement.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="rec-card">
    <h4>Real-Time Feedback</h4>
    <p>Extend live notifications and progress feedback through wearable integrations to reinforce goal completion and sustained engagement.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Additional Context & Sampling

In this exercise, our **objective** was to leverage quantitative fitness usage data and transform it into actionable insight, by contextualizing the data thorugh personas and behavior framing, applying a structured analytical workflow, and producing product & marketing recommendations grounded in observed user behavior. The output was an executive style presentation that would be shared with, or distributed to, stakeholders to accelerate alignment and ultimately action product feature evolution. See below for a sampling of the executive presentation, of which you can download in full at the link below.
