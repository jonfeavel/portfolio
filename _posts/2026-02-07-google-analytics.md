## Executive TL/DR
This capstone analyzes smart device usage data for Bellabeat, a women’s wellness technology company, to identify behavioral trends and translate them into actionable product and marketing recommendations. 

I combined quantitative analysis with contextual framing—personas, journeys, and lifecycle considerations—to move beyond descriptive statistics and toward product-relevant insight.
