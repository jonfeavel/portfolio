# How AI is Shifting the Advantage Toward Outcome-Driven Citizens
I believe AI will terraform the technology industry, and corporations, despite what they may signal don't fully grasp what that means or how to leverage it. It is my belief that outside-in thinking - which started getting traction during the recent waves of API modernization - will be taken a huge step further with AI. The future won't be about customers using your products or solutions, it will be about your products and solutions existing wherever your customers are and this means the technical will slowly become less of a barrier and the average citizen will be empowered to make change once again.
