# CS Operations Framework
Back in 2025, and following the recommendation of one of my mentors (thanks DD), I read Wayne McCullock's *The Seven Pillars of Customer Success*. I found it to be a refreshing and a huge mental unlock. Wayne lays out frameworks for stripping out the noise and focusing on what should matter most in enterprise initiatives: driving to success for your customers. In the supplement below, I've attempted to extract the key elements for my future quick-reference that I hpe you may benefit form as well.
