## The Customer Success (CS) Operations Framework

Back in 2025, and following the recommendation of one of my mentors (thanks, DL), I read Wayne McCullock’s *The Seven Pillars of Customer Success*. I found it both refreshing and a genuine mental unlock for someone who lives these challenges day-to-day.

Wayne lays out pragmatic frameworks for stripping away noise and refocusing enterprise initiatives on what matters most: **driving meaningful outcomes for customers**.

The biggest realization I had while engaging with his material was how well these principles hold up—*especially* when mapped to the AI-driven economy that is increasingly shaping how work gets done. As AI lowers the cost of execution and accelerates decision-making, clarity around outcomes, value realization, and accountability becomes even more critical—not less.

Below are a few excerpts from a quick-reference framework I distilled while working through the material.
