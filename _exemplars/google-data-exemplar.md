# Project Overview
This capstone was a key "cap stone" on the Google Data Analysts course which I highly recommend. In the last phase of the certification, you take on a fabricated company, specifically some curated data, to try and derive insights and inform executive decisions of the company. It was the first real application of the skills and tools you pickup in the class. Drawing on supplementary principals, I've distilled the output into a user-friendly PDF which you can click on to access below. 

### Key Insights
* Practical application of Data Analysis 
* Leveraging AI to bolster the analysis in various tools 
* Human-in-the-loop is critical to ensure the messaging - even contrived messaging - is accurately portrayed
